                    <p>Along with 1 year of HTML markup, I too have 1 year of CSS3 styling.  I am currently learning more about the grid system
                    that works with cross-platform designing.</p>

                    <p>I am currently working on taking a MOOC through EdX for linux administration.  I have operated linux on a variety of personal
                        systems.  Flavors include Arch, Backtrack (Known as Kali Linux), CentOS, Debian, Mint, and Ubuntu.</p>

            <p>I have learned a lot of these skills through personal interest.  I thrive to learn new technology and methods to boost my productivity
            behind a keyboard.  At the helm of my interests it has always been Linux.  I absolutely love the power you have with the open source software
            that closed source software cannot rival.  I enjoy tinkering with various languages that I would enjoy being proficient at, and would like to
            achieve getting my foot in the door with a company that is willing to help me exceed in such skills.</p>

            <div class="content-title"><h2>Interests</h2></div>
            <p>With all of the rapid changes in technology, it is hard to decide on the path to take to fully excel in one category.  From gaming, to advances
            in AI development, and to electronics.  I have a few arduinos that I have coded to do small actions, and I have repaired various chipsets for
            monitors and motherboards.  I would like to learn more about developing electronical interfaces with the Raspberry Pi and the arduino for
            various things such as automotive gauges and various household appliances.  I like the technical side of things because you not only get to
            build your project, but you get to see it in action!</p>
